# Agile Principles Blog 6

Welcome to the sixth installment of reviewing the Principles of Agile from the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilemanifesto.org) Let's check out our next principle together:  _"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."_ Which once again is a simple reasonable principle. We want to be effective in what we do, and with most things in our life communicating effectively is crucially important to our success.

So, why is face to face communication the most effective and efficient?  The signatories of the manifesto don't seem like the type to deal in absolutes, and I think "the most," seems pretty absolute.  So, why would they frame this principle in this way?  Why is face-to-face conversation so highly valued?  We spend all day in front of screens, typing away, reading our words and those of others, why aren't typing an email, sending a skype message, writing a letter, having a phone call as effective as face-to-face conversations?

Face-to-Face conversations are the most effective for one reason:  Feedback.  This type of communication is the way we communicate where we get the most feedback the fastest.  This is what agile is all about!  Every step away from face-to-face is a step away from feedback.  The slower we get feedback, the slower we are to respond and the slower we are to solve a problem.  We have a plethora of options rather than talking to one another thanks to technology.  Some methods are close, but none are as effective as sitting down together face-to-face both in speed and quality of feedback.

Please, take a step to communicate more effectively with whomever you work.  Strive for talking over typing.  The more complicated the topic, the more important it is to talk it through face-to-face.  Just like a lot of things in life that seem counter-intuitive, talking is more effecient and effective than typing.  What do you think?
