# Agile Principles Blog #4

We are one third of the way through 2019 with this blog post; what are you taking away from each one?  How can you use these concepts to make the next two thirds of your year better?  This month we look at the fourth principle underlying the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilemanifesto.org).  This principle is:  _"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."_  Seems pretty self explanatory really.

Let's focus on the most important part of this princple and the most important part of software development:  **People**.  We see it all over the technology industry, an excited group of people get together behind one idea, and what do we get?  Disruption.

Disruption occurs because of many reasons, but one of the most important is execution.  It doesn't matter how many other people have an idea because it's the group who executes on the idea who wins.  How do we become a disruptor?  We execute, How do we execute better? We live this principle!

How can you better live this principle in your areas?  Do you feel like you have an environment that supports your motivated individuals?  Do peers trust peers?  Do teams trust their leaders?  Do your business partners trust your teams to execute?
