# Agile Principles Blog 3

Happy March, and welcome back for another installment where we will discuss the third principle of agile:  **"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."**  If you want to take a look at all of the principles of agile, check them out here [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org)

This principle seems easier said than accomplished. However, what is stopping your teams from delivering the software you build each day, week, or month?  Understanding the constraints of what is preventing frequent regular releases of what you build is the first step.  In my experience we're never quite "ready," to release.  When we show off some software we have built, we built it in a way that "isn't quite production ready." So, we spend another few days or weeks or months getting there, then we wonder why our stakeholders get frustrated about our "speed to market."

My answer, do it right the first time, and don't show something off unless you're ready to ship it.  Every day we make choices about what we are going to do an how we are going to do it.  Do we write unit tests? Do we use [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)? Do we really understand what we're building? Do we really understand why we are building it?  It's really easy to choose to take shortcuts so we can "deliver more," but often these shortcuts end up slowing us down and preventing us from delivering working software.

What do you think?  What slows you down?  Why don't you deliver software frequently?
